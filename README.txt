My CMEE Coursework Repository

Author : Wenhua Zhou (wz2812@ic.ac.uk)

This repository includes all the coursework I have done from the course MRes in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution. 

This course begins in October 2019 and ends in September 2020. 

Every week I will update the work I did including the practicals and miniprojects.

Hopefully I can learn more about programming this year, and this repository can also be useful in the future.
