# Q1 Count how many lines are in each file

# Use "wc -l" to print the line counts of a file
# 1.1 407228326.fasta
cat 407228326.fasta | wc -l
# 1.2 407228412.fasta
cat 407228412.fasta | wc -l
# 1.3 E.coli.fasta
cat E.coli.fasta | wc -l

# Q2 Print everything starting from the second line for the E. coli genome

# use "head" to choose the first two lines and "tail" to pick the second one
cat E.coli.fasta | head -2 | tail -1

# Q3 Count the sequence length of this genome

# use wc -m to count the characters of sequence
# note that the genome start from the second line, so use tail to remove first line
# also remove the newline characters
cat E.coli.fasta | tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n' | wc -m

# Q4 Count the matches of "ATGC" in E. coli

# after choosing from second line and remove newline characters,
# use "grep -o" to find all the matches of ATGC listed in lines
# then count the number of lines of "ATGC" using "wc -l"
cat E.coli.fasta | tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n' | grep -o ATGC | wc -l

# Q5 Compute the AT/GC ratio

# AT/GC ratio equals to the number of "A"s and "T"s divided by the number of "G"s and "C"s
# grep two letters at once
# set those numbers to be variable "x" and "y"
# use "bc -l" to calculate percentage in bash
x=`cat E.coli.fasta | tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n' | grep -o 'A\|T' | wc -l`
y=`cat E.coli.fasta | tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n' | grep -o 'G\|C' | wc -l`
echo "$x/$y" | bc -l
# the results should be 0.969...
